Ajax-mirror
===========

A casperjs script for cloning ajax and javascript heavy websites for offline viewing.

Uses [mockjax](https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax) to mock ajax calls to local JSON.

Currently about 45% working.

Note: This script is currently site specific, I'll change that soon.

Usage:
```
$capserjs Ajax-mirror.js
```
